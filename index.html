                    The process of mastering English is very similar to the process of building a building. If you want to get a stable high structure (to master the language at a high level), you should take care of laying a strong foundation. And the foundation of any language is grammar. It is a good grammar base that will allow you to speak English and be understood by foreigners.
                </p>
                <p>we have prepared an overview of the 4 best English grammar textbooks: we have told you in detail about the advantages and features of each of the textbooks, so that you can choose the best manual for yourself. All editions contain theoretical and practical parts: you will learn the rules and immediately practice them in the exercises. Each of the manuals can be used both for self-study and for working with a teacher. Thanks to regular lessons in one of the textbooks, you will quickly master even complex grammatical topics.

                    If you are just starting to learn English or want to quickly repeat its basics, we recommend that you read the series of articles "English Grammar for beginners".</p>
<p>Each lesson takes only two pages: on the left — theory, on the right-practical exercises. The theoretical material is presented briefly, in simple language, sometimes presented schematically. Raymond Murphy himself advises working with the book as follows: read the theory, do the exercises, check them in the keys at the end of the textbook. The manual also has a block of appendices with additional reference materials. Be sure to take the time to study them, as they explain important aspects of grammar.</p>
